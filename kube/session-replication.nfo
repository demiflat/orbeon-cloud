Session replication in Tomcat ensures that if one instance of Tomcat fails, the user session data is not lost, and the user can continue using the application seamlessly on another instance. In Kubernetes, this can be achieved by deploying multiple replicas of the Tomcat application server and configuring session replication between them. Here are the steps to achieve session replication on Tomcat deployed to Kubernetes:

1. Deploy multiple replicas of Tomcat application server in Kubernetes using a deployment or statefulset.

2. Ensure that each replica has a unique hostname or IP address and is accessible by the other replicas in the cluster. This can be achieved using Kubernetes service or ingress resources.

3. Configure session replication in Tomcat by modifying the `context.xml` file in the `conf` directory of the Tomcat installation. The `context.xml` file should include the following elements:

```
<Manager className="org.apache.catalina.ha.session.DeltaManager"
         expireSessionsOnShutdown="false"
         notifyListenersOnReplication="true"/>

<Channel className="org.apache.catalina.tribes.group.GroupChannel">
  <Membership className="org.apache.catalina.tribes.membership.McastService"
              address="228.0.0.4"
              port="45564"
              frequency="500"
              dropTime="3000"/>
  <Receiver className="org.apache.catalina.tribes.transport.nio.NioReceiver"
            address="${jvmRoute}"
            port="4000"
            selectorTimeout="100"
            maxThreads="6"/>
  <Sender className="org.apache.catalina.tribes.transport.ReplicationTransmitter">
    <Transport className="org.apache.catalina.tribes.transport.nio.PooledParallelSender"/>
  </Sender>
  <Interceptor className="org.apache.catalina.tribes.group.interceptors.TcpFailureDetector"/>
  <Interceptor className="org.apache.catalina.tribes.group.interceptors.MessageDispatch15Interceptor"/>
</Channel>
```

4. The `Manager` element configures the session manager to use `DeltaManager` class, which implements session replication. The `notifyListenersOnReplication` attribute enables notifications to listeners when a session is replicated.

5. The `Channel` element configures the network communication channel between Tomcat replicas. The `Membership` element configures the multicast address and port for membership messages. The `Receiver` element configures the receiver for incoming messages. The `Sender` element configures the sender for outgoing messages. The `Interceptor` elements add additional features to the communication channel, such as failure detection and message dispatch.

6. Update the `server.xml` file in the `conf` directory to include the `jvmRoute` attribute in the `<Engine>` element. This attribute specifies a unique identifier for each Tomcat replica.

7. Deploy the modified Tomcat image to Kubernetes, and the session replication configuration should be in effect.

That's it! With these steps, you should have successfully configured session replication on Tomcat deployed to Kubernetes.
